VCV Rack lacks a macro facility, but the Stoermelder Strip module presents a working reasonable surrogate. This repository stores VCVSS files which require the Strip module to be loaded in a patch first, then using its own context menu, subpatches can be loaded. Signal inputs are annotated with td410 where possible. Signal outputs can be taken from anywhere, but the modules are grouped so that the righmost module's outputs most likely carry the output signal.
